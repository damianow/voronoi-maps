### Voronoi Maps

This project can be used to generate [Voronoi maps](http://chriszetter.com/blog/2014/06/14/visualising-supermarkets-with-a-voronoi-diagram/) using D3 and Leaflet.

See an [explanation of the code](http://chriszetter.com/blog/2014/06/15/building-a-voronoi-map-with-d3-and-leaflet/) and a [demo](http://chriszetter.com/voronoi-map/examples/uk-supermarkets/).

The code is released under the The MIT License. The names and the details the stores used in the `uk-supermarkets` example remain copyright of their respective owners.

This code was forked from Chris Zetter on [building a Voronoi map with D3 and Leaflet] (http://chriszetter.com/blog/2014/06/15/building-a-voronoi-map-with-d3-and-leaflet/).
